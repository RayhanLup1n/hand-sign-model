## Overview
This project focuses on building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of recognizing different hand gestures from images. The main tasks include data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluating the model's performance. The goal is to achieve a high accuracy in classifying gestures into their respective categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of hand gestures, which are split into training and testing sets. You can download the dataset from Google Drive using the following links:

- [Train Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1volmvyVVMTCvo7zjHy2g8gKpTbut1k69?usp=drive_link)
- [Test Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14IzZxDnqGZK8sfNFTHbgiTma-Sb1fq1-?usp=sharing)

Please download and extract the dataset into the appropriate directories before running the project.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for image classification tasks.

Key components of the model:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the images using filters.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: After flattening the features, the model uses dense layers to classify the images into gesture categories.

Additional techniques:
- **Dropout**: Used to prevent overfitting.
- **ReLU Activation**: Applied to introduce non-linearity in the network.
- **Softmax**: Used in the output layer for multi-class classification.

## Training
The following steps outline the model training process:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Images are resized to a uniform dimension.
   - Normalization of pixel values to range [0, 1].
   - Data augmentation (e.g., rotation, zoom) to improve model generalization.
   
2. **Training Process**:
   - The model is trained using the training dataset.
   - The Adam optimizer is used to adjust the weights of the network.
   - Cross-entropy loss function is used since it's a classification problem.
   - Early stopping is applied to prevent overfitting.

3. **Hyperparameters**:
   - Batch Size: 32
   - Epochs: 25 (can be adjusted)
   - Learning Rate: 0.001

## Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated using the test dataset. The following metrics are used to assess its performance:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly classified images.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a detailed view of misclassified gestures.
- **Loss and Accuracy Curves**: Visualize the modelâ€™s learning progress during training and validation phases.
